# NNStreamer

Neural Network Support as Gstreamer Plugins.

NNStreamer is a set of Gstreamer plugins, which allows
Gstreamer developers to adopt neural network models easily and efficiently and
neural network developers to manage stream pipelines and their filters easily and efficiently.

## Objectives

- Provide neural network framework connectivities (e.g., tensorflow, caffe) for gstreamer streams.
  - **Efficient Streaming for AI Projects**: Neural network models wanted to use efficient and flexible streaming management as well.
  - **Intelligent Media Filters!**: Use a neural network model as a media filter / converter.
  - **Composite Models!**: Allow to use multiple neural network models in a single stream instance.
  - **Multi Modal Intelligence!**: Allow to use multiple sources for neural network models.

- Provide easy methods to construct media streams with neural network models using the de-facto-standard media stream framework, **GStreamer**.
  - Allow any gstreamer users to put neural network models as if they are media filters.
  - Allow any neural network developers to manage media streams fairly easily.

## Components

Note that this project has just started and many of the components are in design phase.
In [Component Description](Documentation/component-description.md) page, we describe nnstreamer components of the following three categories: data type definitions, gstreamer elements (plugins), and other misc components.
