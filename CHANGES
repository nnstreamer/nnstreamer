0.0.2 -> 0.0.3:
	- Support external recurrencies with tensor_repo (more test cases are to be released later)
	- Support multi-operators with a single instance of tensor_transform (with a few limitations on the supported orders of operators)
	- Support split
	- Support bounding-box decoding (tensor_decoder)
	- Support subplugins for tensor_decoder
	- Internal APIs for dynamic configurations and subplugins. tensor_filter and tensor_decoder will be updated to use such configurations in the later releases.
	- Tensorflow support is in-progress, it's postponed to later releases. (Still, tensorflow-lite is the only framework officially supported)
	- Pipeviz support. (tensor_converter/filter/decoder)
	- Tested with MTCNN (each "part" is separated as an instance of tensor_filter).
	- Meson build introduced.
	- Released via build.tizen.org (Tizen Devel. x64/x86/arm32/arm64) and launchpad.net (Ubuntu/PPA. x64/x86/arm32/arm64)
	- Static build for Android (Not tested. No example. An example Android application is to be released later)
	- Timestamp handling / Synchronization support
	- AWS App Testing Enabled (testing nnstreamer application with virtual camera devices in AWS)
	- arm64 support added

0.0.1 -> 0.0.2:
	- Support multi-tensors (other/tensors) along with mux, demux.
	- Support audio, test, binary-octet streams (tensor converter)
	- Support image-classification decoding (tensor_decoder)
	- Support merge.
	- More subfeatures for transform
	- Support frame-merging by time (tensor_aggregator)
	- More test cases w/ TAOS_CI integration.
	- Applied to and tested w/ real products.
