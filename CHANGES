0.1.2 -> 0.2.0:
	- A lot of security issues and bugs fixed (for Tizen 5.5 M1 release)
	- Tizen Public C-API Pipeline for 5.5 M1
	- Tizen Public C-API SingleShot Prototype
	- Yocto/Openembedded layer released
	- ROS sink/src
	- IIO support
	- Android source draft
	- Python custom filter
	- Android sample application released
	- Tensorflow-lite / NNAPI support

0.1.1 -> 0.1.2:
	- Tizen Public C-API Draft Prototype
	- Yocto/Openembedded Layer Tested.
	- ROS sink/src supported and partially tested.
	- IIO support draft
	- Custom filter codegen
	- Capability to cut the dependencies on audio/video plugins for minimal memory footprint.
	- More clear error messages when the pipeline cannot be initiated.
	- Increased unit test coverages with additional unit test cases.
	- Minor feature adds on elements.
	- A series of bug fixes.

0.1.0 -> 0.1.1:
	- Full "Plug & Play" capability of subplugins (tensor_filter, tensor_filter::custom, tensor_decoder)
		- Fully configurable subplugin locations
		- Capability to build subplungins wihtout the dependencies on nnstreamer sources
	- Revert Tensorflow input-memcpy-less-ness for multi-tensor support. (Will support memcpy-less-ness later)
	- Support "String" type of tensors
	- API sets updated (still not "stable")
	- Code location refactored.
	- Yocto/Openembedded Layer Registered (not tested): "meta-neural-network"
	- No more additional shared libraries.
	- Better error handling and messages for a few plugins
	- Android support (N / arm64)

0.0.3 -> 0.1.0:
	- Build system migration cmake --> meson
	- Support Tensorflow without input/output tensor memcpy
	- other/tensor stream format updated
		- From 0.1.0, a single property, "dimension", describes the whole dimension instead of "dim1", "dim2", ...
		- Objective 1: in the future, we may support tensors with more than 4 dimensions without updating the protocol.
		- Objective 2: it was just too ugly.
	- Example applications migrated to other git repo to make this repo ready for upstreaming in the future and to ensure buildability for third party developers.
	- Support run-time attaching subplugins (filter and decoder)
	- Support "ini" and envvar configurations for subplugin locations
	- Dynamic external recurrences
	- Subplugin API sets (draft. do not expect backward compatibility)
	- Bug fixes (memory leaks, incorrect logs, type checks, ...)

0.0.2 -> 0.0.3:
	- Support external recurrencies with tensor_repo (more test cases are to be released later)
	- Support multi-operators with a single instance of tensor_transform (with a few limitations on the supported orders of operators)
	- Support split
	- Support bounding-box decoding (tensor_decoder)
	- Support subplugins for tensor_decoder
	- Internal APIs for dynamic configurations and subplugins. tensor_filter and tensor_decoder will be updated to use such configurations in the later releases.
	- Tensorflow support is in-progress, it's postponed to later releases. (Still, tensorflow-lite is the only framework officially supported)
	- Pipeviz support. (tensor_converter/filter/decoder)
	- Tested with MTCNN (each "part" is separated as an instance of tensor_filter).
	- Meson build introduced.
	- Released via build.tizen.org (Tizen Devel. x64/x86/arm32/arm64) and launchpad.net (Ubuntu/PPA. x64/x86/arm32/arm64)
	- Static build for Android (Not tested. No example. An example Android application is to be released later)
	- Timestamp handling / Synchronization support
	- AWS App Testing Enabled (testing nnstreamer application with virtual camera devices in AWS)
	- arm64 support added

0.0.1 -> 0.0.2:
	- Support multi-tensors (other/tensors) along with mux, demux.
	- Support audio, test, binary-octet streams (tensor converter)
	- Support image-classification decoding (tensor_decoder)
	- Support merge.
	- More subfeatures for transform
	- Support frame-merging by time (tensor_aggregator)
	- More test cases w/ TAOS_CI integration.
	- Applied to and tested w/ real products.
