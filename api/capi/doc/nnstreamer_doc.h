 * @section CAPI_ML_NNSTREAMER_PIPELINE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The NNStreamer function provides interfaces to create and execute stream pipelines with neural networks and sensors.
 *
 *  This function allows the following operations with NNStreamer:
 * - Create a stream pipeline with NNStreamer plugins, GStreamer plugins, and sensor/camera/mic inputs.
 * - Interfaces to push data to the pipeline from the application.
 * - Interfaces to pull data from the pipeline to the application.
 * - Interfaces to start/stop/destroy the pipeline.
 * - Interfaces to control switches and valves in the pipeline.
 * - Utility functions to handle data from the pipeline.
 *
 *  Note that this function set is supposed to be thread-safe.

 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/machine_learning.inference\n
 *
 * It is recommended to probe features in your application for reliability.\n
 * You can check if a device supports the related features for this function by using
 * @ref CAPI_SYSTEM_SYSTEM_INFO_MODULE, thereby controlling the procedure of
 * your application.\n
 * To ensure your application is only running on the device with specific
 * features, please define the features in your manifest file using the manifest
 * editor in the SDK.\n
 * For example, your application accesses to the camera device,
 * then you have to add 'http://tizen.org/privilege/camera' into the manifest of your application.\n
 * More details on featuring your application can be found from

 * @brief The NNStreamer Single API provides interfaces to invoke a neural network model with a single instance of input data.
 * @section CAPI_ML_NNSTREAMER_SINGLE_HEADER Required Header
 *   \#include <nnstreamer/nnstreamer-single.h>\n
 *
 * @section CAPI_ML_NNSTREAMER_SINGLE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The NNStreamer Single API provides interfaces to invoke a neural network model with a single instance of input data.
 * This function is a syntactic sugar of NNStreamer Pipeline API with simplified features; thus, users are supposed to use NNStreamer Pipeline API directly if they want more advanced features.
 * The user is expected to preprocess the input data for the given neural network model.
 *
 * This function allows the following operations with NNStreamer:
 * - Open a machine learning model with various mechanisms.
 * - Close the model.
 * - Interfaces to enter a single instance of input data to the opened model.
 * - Utility functions to get the information of opened model.
 *
 * Note that this function set is supposed to be thread-safe.
