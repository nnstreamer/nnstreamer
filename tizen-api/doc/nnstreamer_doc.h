 * @brief NNStreamer allows to construct and execute a GStreamer pipeline including neural networks.\n
 * NNStreamer is a set of GStreamer plugins that allow GStreamer developers to adopt neural network models easily and efficiently and neural network developers to manage stream pipelines and their filters easily and efficiently. \n
 * https://github.com/nnsuite/nnstreamer/ \n
 * \n
 * Main objectives of NNStreamer include:\n
 * * Provide neural network framework connectivities (e.g., tensorflow, caffe) for gstreamer streams.\n
 *     * **Efficient Streaming for AI Projects**: Apply efficient and flexible stream pipeline to neural networks.\n
 *     * **Intelligent Media Filters!**: Use a neural network model as a media filter / converter.\n
 *     * **Composite Models!**: Multiple neural network models in a single stream pipeline instance.\n
 *     * **Multi Modal Intelligence!**: Multiple sources and stream paths for neural network models.\n
 * * Provide easy methods to construct media streams with neural network models using the de-facto-standard media stream framework, **GStreamer**.\n
 *     * Gstreamer users: use neural network models as if they are yet another media filters.\n
 *     * Neural network developers: manage media streams easily and efficiently.\n
 * \n
 * There are following sub groups proposed:\n
 * * Pipeline: construct and control an NNStreamer pipeline.\n
 * * **TBD** CustomModel: create a custom neural network (C/C++) for an NNStreamer pipeline construction. (tensor_filter::custom)\n
 * * **TBD** PythonModel: create a custom neural network (Python) for an NNStreamer pipeline construction. (TBD)\n
 * * **TBD** NNFW: use new neural network frameworks and their models. (tensor_filter subplugin)\n
 * * **TBD** Decoder: provide a new tensor-to-media decoder. (tensor_decoder subplugin)\n

 *
 * @section CAPI_ML_NNSTREAMER_PIPELINE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The NNStreamer API provides interfaces to create and execute stream pipelines with neural networks and sensors.
 *
 *  This API allows the following operations with NNStreamer:
 * - Create a stream pipeline with NNStreamer plugins, GStreamer plugins, and sensor/camera/mic inputs
 * - Interfaces to push data to the pipeline from the application
 * - Interfaces to pull data from the pipeline to the application
 * - Interfaces to start/stop/destroy the pipeline
 * - Interfaces to control switches and valves in the pipeline.
 *
 *  Note that this API set is supposed to be thread-safe.
 *
 * @section CAPI_ML_NNSTREAMER_PIPELINE_FEATURE Related Features
 * This API is related with the following features (TBD):\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/nnstreamer.pipeline\n
 *
 * It is recommended to probe features in your application for reliability.\n
 * You can check if a device supports the related features for this API by using
 * @ref CAPI_SYSTEM_SYSTEM_INFO_MODULE, thereby controlling the procedure of
 * your application.\n
 * To ensure your application is only running on the device with specific
 * features, please define the features in your manifest file using the manifest
 * editor in the SDK.\n
 * More details on featuring your application can be found from
 * <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/native-tools/configuring-your-app/manifest-text-editor#feature">
 *    <b>Feature Element</b>.
