Package: nnstreamer
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer plugins for Gstreamer
 Gstreamer plugins, "NNStreamer", provides access to neural network frameworks for media streams.

Package: nnstreamer-tensorflow
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer, tensorflow | tensorflow-dev, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer TensorFlow Support
 This package allows nnstreamer to support tensorflow. Note that users must make sure that they have installed Tensorflow with compatible C-API (recommended to use the same version). However, having different options (e.g., GPU mode) should not affect the compatibility. When we have stable C-API from Tensorflow, we will release corresponding subplugin as well.
