Package: nnstreamer
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer plugins for Gstreamer
 Gstreamer plugins, "NNStreamer", provides access to neural network frameworks for media streams.

Package: nnstreamer-tensorflow
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer, tensorflow | tensorflow-dev, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer TensorFlow Support
 This package allows nnstreamer to support tensorflow. Note that users must make sure that they have installed Tensorflow with compatible C-API (recommended to use the same version). However, having different options (e.g., GPU mode) should not affect the compatibility. When we have stable C-API from Tensorflow, we will release corresponding subplugin as well.

Package: nnstreamer-tensorflow-lite
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer TensorFlow Lite Support
 This package allows nnstreamer to support tensorflow-lite.

Package: nnstreamer-pytorch
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer, pytorch, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: NNStreamer Pytorch Support
 This package allows nnstreamer to support pytorch.

Package: nnstreamer-caffe2
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer, pytorch, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

Package: nnstreamer-dev-internal
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: nnstreamer-dev, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development package to access internal functions of NNStreamer.
 This may be used by API packages.
 In most cases, custom-filter or subplugin authors do not need this internal devel package; however, if they want to access more internal functions, they may need this.
